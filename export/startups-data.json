        "company_description": "Graze is building one of the world's first electric, fully-autonomous lawn mowers for the commercial landscaping industry. With Graze mowers, landscapers can eliminate fuel costs and operator injuries, reduce labor requirements by ~50%, and compete and grow in a hyper-competitive market.Graze has signed Letters of Intent from LandCare and Mainscape, 2 of the top 15 commercial landscaping companies in the US. These LOIs outline the potential purchase of 400 mowers, which could represent $36 million in revenue for Graze.*Graze is working directly with LandCare and Mainscape to bring the Graze mower to market. Collectively, LandCare and Mainscape operate ~1,400 mowers across the country and are growing every year. We project this could represent $126 million in gross revenue every 5 years.The $54 billion commercial landscaping industry in the US is a very manual, low-skilled, and low margin sector. Mowing is one of the lowest margin services offered, with labor accounting for about 45% of gross revenue. The best companies in the industry generate only ~10% margins from mowing as rising wages and labor shortages drive costs up and heavy competition drives prices down.Graze believes the introduction of an electric, self-driving mower to the market will be highly disruptive. With Graze, landscapers may reduce 4-5 person teams to 2 people, eliminate fuel costs, increase operating margins, and win new business by undercutting competitors, if desired. Many hardware and equipment manufacturers suffer from \u201cone and done\u201d customer purchasing. This is not the case in landscaping. Commercial landscaping and maintenance companies regularly purchase new equipment at the end of useful life spans (i.e., every 2-5 years). Because of this, Graze has the potential to have meaningful and predictable recurring revenue.*This calculation is based on our intended subscription pricing model of $12,000 per year, per mower and $30,000 upfront equipment price upon launch, times 400 mowers. The Company is currently pre-revenue. This statement reflects management's current views with respect to future events and is subject to risks and uncertainties.",
        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Reg A OfferingsWhat does it mean that the SEC has qualified this offering?\"The SEC has qualified this offering\" means the SEC has permitted Graze to offer for sale the\n  securities described in the Offering Circular to investors such as you. The SEC is not judging the merits, accuracy,\n  or completeness of the offering and information in the Offering Circular.Making an Investment in GrazeHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an\n    independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Graze.

At that point, you\n    will be a proud owner in Graze.What is the difference between preferred equity and a convertible note?Preferred equity is usually issued to outside investors and carries rights and conditions that are\n    different from that of common stock. For example, preferred equity may include rights that prevent or minimize the\n    effects of dilution or grants special privileges in situations when the company is sold.A convertible note is a unique form of debt that converts into equity, usually in conjunction with a future financing round. The investor effectively loans money to a startup with the expectation that they will receive equity in the company in the future at a discounted price per share when the company raises its next round of financing.To learn more about startup investment types check out \u201cHow to Choose a Startup Investment\u201d in our academy.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or passportABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)What if I change my mind about investing?Until a closing occurs, you may cancel your investment at any time, for any reason.

        "product": "Product & ServiceProduct OverviewGraze\u2019s flagship product, its electric, fully autonomous lawn mower aims to be:Electric: quiet, low maintenance24/7 Operable: night mowingSafe: advanced safety protocolsConsistent & PreciseEnvironmentally FriendlyThe Graze mower aims to be powered by a robust sensor suite (i.e., RADAR, LIDAR, GPS, ultrasonic sensors, odometry sensors, and an optical suite) that will enable it to safely and precisely self-navigate in and around commercial job sites.Business Model & Unit EconomicsGraze will offer relatively straightforward pricing on its flagship mower:Upfront Mower Cost: $30,000 (expected $21,000 - 25,000 with solar energy tax credits).Software-As-A-Service Fee: $1,000 per month per mower.While commercial, gas-powered, human-driven mowers can cost between $5,000 - $15,000, Graze expects to receive minimal pushback from customers on its upfront and recurring costs, considering its impact on customer P&Ls. Pre-orders from LandCare and Mainscape suggest initial pricing will be effective. Solar energy tax credits will also allow customers to save up to 30% on equipment cost; we estimate the expected result could be up to ~$9,000 savings, resulting in a net equipment cost of ~$21,000, a number much more in line with that of today\u2019s best-in-class commercial gas-powered mowers.Graze expects its production machines to have a 5-year useful life, defined by the ability to effectively and precisely mow turf through the end of that period. Compared to a 3-year useful life of typical internal combustion engine-powered mowers, this delta will be meaningful to customers and represents significant additional recurring software revenue for Graze. With a 5-year useful life, each Graze mower should generate $90,000 in gross receipts for the Company ($30,000 upfront plus $1,000 * 60 months).TractionWith Landcape and Mainscape customer relationships established via 400 mowers in pre-orders, we believe Graze has validated product-market fit and has secured a built-in path to revenue.\u00a0Moreover, it sends a powerful signal to potential customers that Graze mowers have been validated by 2 large incumbents.Technology & Product RoadmapGraze is more than a mower, Graze is a land maintenance platform. We're aiming to produce 100% electric, fully autonomous landscaping equipment as standalone products and modular mower attachments. Our products will automate the majority of landscape and maintenance service offerings, allowing our customers to hire and retain their most highly-skilled workers, to boost margins and to grow their businesses.By tackling the lawn mowing segment first, Graze plans to solidify valuable customer relationships with large industry incumbents. With fuel and labor costs removed from mowing services via the introduction of its electric, autonomous mower, Graze offers its customers an immediate and substantial boost in profits. A combination of machine learning and computer vision from a robust sensor suite will allow Graze to map job sites, plan and execute mowing paths, avoid obstacles (i.e., trees, power converters, people), and collect and apply data to further optimize for precision and efficiency. Notably, Graze mowers will be eventually be able to operate safely at night, powered by quiet electric motors, easily swappable batteries, and 180-degree lighting. In the future,\u00a0 we expect Graze technology will also track and plan around weather data, detect and defend against turf and plant diseases, provide data analytics and insights to its customers, and, eventually, will manage mower fleets with Artificial Intelligence, thereby providing a reduction in indirect labor costs (i.e., administrative personnel).Gallery{{ active_product_media.title }}.",

When using our system, more than 92% of people report having grown a successful garden.Urban gardening's a pain. City dwellers have small plots, little time, and often feel the hassle of acquiring the right tools and techniques isn\u2019t worth the meager yields their patio, roof deck, etc. will produce. Besides space constraints, urban gardeners often deal w/ toxic or nutrient-poor soil, varied micro-environments, and a lack of natural pollinators.We've developed a solution that addresses these constraints and more by engineering an outdoor garden that's fun, productive, and easy to use. The system leverages an app that captures remote microclimate data to help select the best herbs, fruits, and vegetables for our users environment along with the exact mix of nutrients, minerals, and bacteria missing from their soil. We then aggregate and package all this material (seeds included) into modular square-foot blocks, wrap them in a biodegradable casing, and deliver them directly to our users.

        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor\u2019s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive securities, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in GrowSquaresHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by GrowSquares.

By linking 3D printed implants and advanced robotics via automated digital image analysis algorithms, Monogram has achieved greater stability, implant insertion accuracy, and fit than current conventional methods, based on our collaborative study with UCLA\u00a0Biomechanics Laboratory.Problem:Innovation in orthopedics is slow and inefficient. Large interdependent oligopolistic companies dominate the market with implants that are almost indistinguishable and robotic technology that is costly, limited, slow, and replaceable. As it stands today, almost all of the robotically inserted implants could be inserted with manual instruments. The cost of capital, distribution, and development have built almost insurmountable barriers to entry which has led to four companies having a monopoly of over 76% of the $18B market. Solution:Monogram\u2019s technology enables auto-segmentation of images and auto-generation of implants that will be 3D printed and inserted with our navigated robotic system. This model allows us to create and insert custom implants at scale to tackle the high-volume joint replacement surgery market \u2013 there are at least 700,000 knee replacements and 300,000 hip replacement surgeries performed in the United States each year. In collaboration with\u00a0UCLA Biomechanics Laboratory, our implants have demonstrated a 7x improvement in stability. Based on internal testing we have shown a 7x improvement in bone contact, or fit, and a 13mm improvement in accuracy.\u00a0Monogram has re-imagined implants for the 21st century.  High precision, fully patient specific implants with state-of-the-art robotics to solve real clinical problems.",

The product solution architecture that we are developing enables rapid fabrication and mass personalization of robotically inserted, patient specific orthopaedic implants.Technology Platform:The Monogram technology platform \u2013 a series of algorithms that auto-segment images and auto-generate implants that will be integrated into a navigated robotic system for surgery \u2013 automates the design and insertion of high conforming implants from the raw images using automated digital image analysis algorithms. The navigated robot will then execute optimized auto-generated cut paths that surgically prepare the corresponding cavities to facilitate insertion of the implant.Advantage:We believe that Monogram\u2019s navigated robot features several enhancements that will improve the user experience as compared to the current robots in use. Specifically, the Monogram robot will feature tracking cameras that are mounted directly to the robot to mitigate line-of-sight issues. The robot will feature seven degrees-of-freedom (used to measure range of motion) with control algorithms that leverage the kinematic redundancy to avoid interoperative boundaries and optimize the surgical execution. The robot will also utilize complex tracking capabilities for soft-tissue avoidance.Our Implants:For the patient specific implants, it is generally understood that a tight fit and ease of insertion can be conflicting requirements for a viable implant. The Monogram implants are designed such that cortical contact, and therefore stability, are maximized while remaining insertable. The Monogram implants are designed to reconstruct the native patient anatomy as closely as possible.\u00a0 Monogram will first commercialize a patient specific hip and patient specific knee that will address the primary clinical shortcomings of their generic counterparts.With generic implants in hips for example, manual bone preparation can contribute to periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, leg length inequality, subsidence and early loosening, and suboptimal function outcomes. With generic knee implants aseptic loosening of the tibial component and malalignment are major reasons for failure. Current hip stems have very limited options to restore anatomy. For example, most implants are available in only two widths despite wide human anatomic variations. They are geometric as opposed to organic in shape, which limits the amount of direct bone contact required for initial stability and long-term biological fixation.\u00a0 For generic knee implants, we believe the general design premise of a flat resection plane for the tibial component is flawed.\u00a0 By 2020:Monogram is designing additively manufactured (AM) patient matched titanium hip stems and tibial knee implants that will require robotically milled complementary cavities.\u00a0 \u00a0Our monetizatible products will include:\u00a0Surgical robotic systemCutting tools and navigation consumablesSoftware licensing of clinical modulesPatient specific reconstructive implantsGallery{{ active_product_media.title }}.",

        "company_description": "Unhealthy diets are the leading predictor of mortality. But it\u2019s been nearly impossible to accurately measure and manage diet--until now. With Diet ID, healthcare providers can seamlessly improve nutrition and provide personalized behavior change guidance while cutting costs and saving time.Diet is the #1 cause of premature death and chronic disease, and costs the US $1.4 Trillion per year in health care costs and lost productivity. Diet IS a vital sign, but most health care providers don\u2019t have the time, training, or tools to measure and treat it as such, until now. Diet ID, a digital health SaaS solution, has reinvented how clinicians can assess diet and improve habits within a standard clinic visit, saving 90% of the time and expense associated with existing, ineffective solutions. This is a $39bn market today, but as health care costs rise, the business case for prevention becomes increasingly undeniable. Preventing and managing chronic disease by improving diet will be the new normal, with Diet ID leading the way. Since publicly launching in Q1 2019, Diet ID has proven product market fit by booking over $400K in sales, with clients in health care and wellness, both large and small. Many organizations have tried to improve dietary habits and have failed because of poor assessment methods and flawed, subjective guidance. No team is as uniquely equipped as ours -- our team includes the most cited and respected leaders in preventive medicine, nutrition, culinary arts, and behavior change. We are at the precipice of exponential growth, with a full pipeline. We are raising a $1.5M seed round at a $6M pre-money. We have a lead investor secured and more than half our round. We expect to be profitable within the next 3 years, with at most one additional round of funding. Measuring and improving diet will be a ubiquitous part of the health care workflow. Diet ID is uniquely positioned to not only capture the existing market, but catalyze its growth.\u00a0",
        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsMaking an Investment in Diet IDHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an\n    independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Diet ID.

At that point, you\n    will be a proud owner in Diet ID.What is the difference between preferred equity and a convertible note?Preferred equity is usually issued to outside investors and carries rights and conditions that are\n    different from that of common stock. For example, preferred equity may include rights that prevent or minimize the\n    effects of dilution or grants special privileges in situations when the company is sold.A convertible note is a unique form of debt that converts into equity, usually in conjunction with a future financing round. The investor effectively loans money to a startup with the expectation that they will receive equity in the company in the future at a discounted price per share when the company raises its next round of financing.To learn more about startup investment types check out \u201cHow to Choose a Startup Investment\u201d in our academy.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or passportABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)Because Diet ID is offering its securities under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an\n    Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your\n    income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment\n    Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.What if I change my mind about investing?Until a closing occurs, you may cancel your investment at any time, for any reason.

        "company_description": "American farms are running out of people. Hitch has secured a $2,100,000 LOI from industry leader HMC Farms to develop self-driving farm robots that work alongside existing workers. Our mission is to ensure the future of the American farm.Problem: Today, American farmers are facing a battle on two fronts. First, they compete on price with international farms that export high-quality produce to the US at a fraction of the price. Second, the supply of farm labor in America has dropped to such drastic levels that the US economy is losing $3.1 billion annually in crop production.To make a dire situation worse, American farm labor - when available - is underutilized. Farmworkers spend roughly 30% of their time moving harvested fruit around the farm, time that could otherwise be spent harvesting ready-to-pick produce. When labor in the US represents up to 50% of the total cost of an agricultural product, and international farm labor can be as low as 5%, American farmers are faced with an existential threat.Solution: Hitch is a robotic harvesting assistant for American farms. Its flagship product, the Transport Hitch, is an off-road, self-driving robot capable of transporting fruit (or any payload) on a farm.By partnering with Hitch, farms can reduce their labor burden and increase their productivity by over 40%. Harvest workers will no longer need to push or pull heavy wheelbarrows; they will be able to focus on the skilled task of identifying ready-to-pick fruit and vegetables. But, most importantly, American farms will be able to stay in business. Farms will no longer suffer labor shortages or be unable to harvest and sell their full yields.Traction: Hitch has a signed Letter of Intent from HMC Farms for the purchase of 100 Hitch robots, a contract that represents $2,100,000 in potential revenue.  HMC Farms is more than Hitch\u2019s first customer, it is a founding partner with 5% ownership. As a key stakeholder, HMC has worked closely with the Hitch team to design and build a Robotic Harvesting Assistant that is built for the industry, by the industry.\u00a0",

To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans.

        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor\u2019s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive securities, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in EpilogHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Epilog. Once Epilog accepts your investment, and certain regulatory procedures are completed, your money will be transferred from the escrow account to Epilog in exchange for your securities. At that point, you will be a proud owner in Epilog.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or passportABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)If you are investing under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.How much can I invest?An investor is limited in the amount that he or she may invest in a Reg CF offering during any 12-month period:If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth.If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth, to a maximum of $100,000.Separately, Epilog has set a minimum investment amount of US $1,000.Accredited investors investing $20,000 or over do not have investment limits.After My InvestmentWhat is my ongoing relationship with the Issuer?You are a partial owner of the company, you do own securities after all! But more importantly, companies which have raised money via Regulation CF must file information with the SEC and post it on their websites on an annual basis. Receiving regular company updates is important to keep shareholders educated and informed about the progress of the company and their investment. This annual report includes information similar to a company\u2019s initial Reg CF filing and key information that a company will want to share with its investors to foster a dynamic and healthy relationship.In certain circumstances a company may terminate its ongoing reporting requirement if:The company becomes a fully-reporting registrant with the SECThe company has filed at least one annual report, but has no more than 300 shareholders of recordThe company has filed at least three annual reports, and has no more than $10 million in assetsThe company or another party purchases or repurchases all the securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)The company ceases to do businessHowever, regardless of whether a company has terminated its ongoing reporting requirement per SEC rules, SeedInvest works with all companies on its platform to ensure that investors are provided quarterly updates. These quarterly reports will include information such as: (i) quarterly net sales, (ii) quarterly change in cash and cash on hand, (iii) material updates on the business, (iv) fundraising updates (any plans for next round, current round status, etc.), and (v) any notable press and news.How can I sell my securities in the future?Currently there is no market or liquidity for these securities. Right now Epilog does not plan to list these securities on a national exchange or another secondary market. At some point Epilog may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a \u201cliquidation event\u201d occurs. A \u201cliquidation event\u201d is when Epilog either lists their securities on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.How do I keep track of this investment?You can return to SeedInvest at any time to view your portfolio of investments and obtain a summary statement.

We\u2019re developing technology to assist and empower chefs to make food consistently and perfectly, at prices everyone can afford.Introducing FlippyWe designed Flippy (12 patents pending, one awarded) to cook food alongside chefs in commercial kitchens. Computer and thermal vision allow the robot to cook food perfectly and consistently every time.Miso has doubled revenue (2018-2019) and Flippy is now a household name with  10 billion+ organic media impressions and is currently cooking food in LA Dodgers Stadium, Arizona Diamondbacks Chase Field, and three CaliBurger locations.Solving the Labor ProblemThe $273B global Quick Service Restaurant industry has increasingly tight margins (~5%) due to rising wages and a worsening workforce shortage.  While Americans are cooking at home less, it is becoming increasingly harder for restaurants to hire kitchen staff to serve them. According to CEO of CaliGroup, implementing Flippy will reduce kitchen labor expenses by over 65% while increasing efficiency and the amount of food cooked by 23%.With Flippy, restaurants can increase profit margins from 5% to a healthy 14%, which translates into a 3x increase in EBITDA, creating significant value for our customers.RoadmapAfter success with its pilot in CaliBurger\u2019s Pasadena, CA location, the restaurant recently signed an $11 million purchase order to implement two Flippy bots at each of its 50+ locations worldwide. In October, 2019, the first \u201cCaliBurger 2.0\u201d opened in Ft. Myers, Florida with its reinvented kitchen that includes two Flippys working alongside one chef.We\u2019re currently developing \u201cFlippy 2.0,\u201d which integrates the bot into a mounted rail system, allowing it to work on several tasks at once. This new system is 50% less expensive and requires zero real estate footprint in a commercial kitchen.Miso Robotics is poised to increase efficiency, profitability and food quality for the entire restaurant industry and bring us closer to the kitchen of the future.",

        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor\u2019s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive securities, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in PolitiscopeHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Politiscope. Once Politiscope accepts your investment, and certain regulatory procedures are completed, your money will be transferred from the escrow account to Politiscope in exchange for your securities. At that point, you will be a proud owner in Politiscope.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or passportABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)If you are investing under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.How much can I invest?An investor is limited in the amount that he or she may invest in a Reg CF offering during any 12-month period:If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth.If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth, to a maximum of $100,000.Separately, Politiscope has set a minimum investment amount of US $1,000.Accredited investors investing $20,000 or over do not have investment limits.After My InvestmentWhat is my ongoing relationship with the Issuer?You are a partial owner of the company, you do own securities after all! But more importantly, companies which have raised money via Regulation CF must file information with the SEC and post it on their websites on an annual basis. Receiving regular company updates is important to keep shareholders educated and informed about the progress of the company and their investment. This annual report includes information similar to a company\u2019s initial Reg CF filing and key information that a company will want to share with its investors to foster a dynamic and healthy relationship.In certain circumstances a company may terminate its ongoing reporting requirement if:The company becomes a fully-reporting registrant with the SECThe company has filed at least one annual report, but has no more than 300 shareholders of recordThe company has filed at least three annual reports, and has no more than $10 million in assetsThe company or another party purchases or repurchases all the securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)The company ceases to do businessHowever, regardless of whether a company has terminated its ongoing reporting requirement per SEC rules, SeedInvest works with all companies on its platform to ensure that investors are provided quarterly updates. These quarterly reports will include information such as: (i) quarterly net sales, (ii) quarterly change in cash and cash on hand, (iii) material updates on the business, (iv) fundraising updates (any plans for next round, current round status, etc.), and (v) any notable press and news.How can I sell my securities in the future?Currently there is no market or liquidity for these securities. Right now Politiscope does not plan to list these securities on a national exchange or another secondary market. At some point Politiscope may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a \u201cliquidation event\u201d occurs. A \u201cliquidation event\u201d is when Politiscope either lists their securities on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.How do I keep track of this investment?You can return to SeedInvest at any time to view your portfolio of investments and obtain a summary statement. If invested under Regulation CF you may also receive periodic updates from the company about their business, in addition to monthly account statements.Other General QuestionsWhat is this page about?This is Politiscope's fundraising profile page, where you can find information that may be helpful for you to make an investment decision in their company.

To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in PeachHow does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Peach. Once Peach accepts your investment, and certain regulatory procedures are completed, your money will be transferred from the escrow account to Peach in exchange for your securities. At that point, you will be a proud owner in Peach.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or passportABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)If you are investing under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.How much can I invest?An investor is limited in the amount that he or she may invest in a Reg CF offering during any 12-month period:If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth.If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth, to a maximum of $100,000.Separately, Peach has set a minimum investment amount of US $1,000.Accredited investors investing $20,000 or over do not have investment limits.After My InvestmentWhat is my ongoing relationship with the Issuer?You are a partial owner of the company, you do own securities after all! But more importantly, companies which have raised money via Regulation CF must file information with the SEC and post it on their websites on an annual basis. Receiving regular company updates is important to keep shareholders educated and informed about the progress of the company and their investment. This annual report includes information similar to a company\u2019s initial Reg CF filing and key information that a company will want to share with its investors to foster a dynamic and healthy relationship.In certain circumstances a company may terminate its ongoing reporting requirement if:The company becomes a fully-reporting registrant with the SECThe company has filed at least one annual report, but has no more than 300 shareholders of recordThe company has filed at least three annual reports, and has no more than $10 million in assetsThe company or another party purchases or repurchases all the securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)The company ceases to do businessHowever, regardless of whether a company has terminated its ongoing reporting requirement per SEC rules, SeedInvest works with all companies on its platform to ensure that investors are provided quarterly updates. These quarterly reports will include information such as: (i) quarterly net sales, (ii) quarterly change in cash and cash on hand, (iii) material updates on the business, (iv) fundraising updates (any plans for next round, current round status, etc.), and (v) any notable press and news.How can I sell my securities in the future?Currently there is no market or liquidity for these securities. Right now Peach does not plan to list these securities on a national exchange or another secondary market. At some point Peach may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a \u201cliquidation event\u201d occurs. A \u201cliquidation event\u201d is when Peach either lists their securities on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.How do I keep track of this investment?You can return to SeedInvest at any time to view your portfolio of investments and obtain a summary statement. If invested under Regulation CF you may also receive periodic updates from the company about their business, in addition to monthly account statements.Other General QuestionsWhat is this page about?This is Peach's fundraising profile page, where you can find information that may be helpful for you to make an investment decision in their company. The information on this page includes the company overview, team bios, and the risks and disclosures related to this investment opportunity. If the company runs a side by side offering that includes an offering under Regulation CF, you may also find a copy of the Peach's Form C. The Form C includes important details about Peach's fundraise that you should review before investing.How can I (or the company) cancel my investment under Regulation CF?For offerings made under Regulation CF, you may cancel your investment at any time up to 48 hours before a closing occurs or an earlier date set by the company. You will be sent a reminder notification approximately five days before the closing or set date giving you an opportunity to cancel your investment if you had not already done so. Once a closing occurs, and if you have not canceled your investment, you will receive an email notifying you that your securities have been issued. If you have already funded your investment, your funds will be promptly refunded to you upon cancellation. To cancel your investment, you may go to your account's portfolio page by clicking your profile icon in the top right corner.What if I change my mind about investing?If you invest under any other offering type, you may cancel your investment at any time, for any reason until a closing occurs. You will receive an email when the closing occurs and your securities have been issued. If you have already funded your investment and your funds are in escrow, your funds will be promptly refunded to you upon cancellation.

Laser-focused on the needs of our industrial customers, we're reducing time and cost in product development and facilitating local manufacturing with little to no downtime.While the adoption of 3D printing for product development is now widespread, the technology also has massive advantages in production applications. It enables manufacturing low volume batches close to the centers of consumption, with no material waste and fewer shipments, resulting in a reduction in time, cost and carbon footprint. For production companies to transition into this technology, they need to see the same repeatability, accuracy, scalability, manageability and material versatility they have with traditional manufacturing.From the beginning, our focus has been to offer the solutions required by exacting customers like John Deere: an ecosystem comprised of reliable hardware, production-grade materials, empowering software and first-class service. The KODAK Portrait is a fully-enclosed, dual extrusion 3D printer capable of reliably printing in a wide range of materials. KODAK 3D Printing Filaments show the broadest material range in the market, with strict tolerances and a unique process for moisture control to ensure repeatable prints. The\u00a0KODAK 3D Slicer and\u00a0KODAK 3D Cloud enable remote management of 3D printer farms. Our production solution will now enable them to transition from development to production within one seamless process, using the same materials with scalable hardware modules. This way we can guarantee repeatable identical parts produced at industry-leading accuracy, resolution and speed.With over 400 printers and 18,000 filament spools sold, distribution agreements with the leading VAR's, reputable reviews and the Kodak brand, the company has shown some great achievements. By completing the already rich desktop solution with disruptive industrial systems, we believe the company is placed at an unbeatable position to lead the 3D printing market.",

        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise.

Expedited one-hour delivery is also offered for a $5.00 charge. All pharmacy services are provided from a low cost, highly automated \"virtual pharmacy\" location, utilizing end-to-end robotic dispensing (\"One-Click Fill\") and artificially intelligent chat bots, coupled with NowRx drivers and plug-in electric vehicles, to provide a more efficient and effective pharmacy experience for busy customers. For Customers & Physicians: We offer our services through the NowRx app, by text, by telephone, and through virtual assistants such as Google Home. Physicians are able to send prescriptions to NowRx through electronic prescribing, fax, the NowRx app, or telephone. Current services provided include fulfilling new prescriptions or refills, transferring prescriptions from other pharmacies, consulting pharmacists via phone, and applying of drug manufacturer coupons.Data-Driven: NowRx's business automatically generates a substantial database recording a wealth of medical prescription data. This affords the company the opportunity to develop, using machine-learning techniques, powerful tools to initiate pharmacy interventions for patients more likely to miss a dose or refill (NowRx Medication Adherence Index), thereby providing better medication adherence and improved health outcomes.Market & Vision: NowRx is responding to the rapidly increasing consumer demand for services delivered same-day and managed by convenience of mobile apps, chat bots, and voice-activated assistants. The on-demand economy has already attracted more than 22.4 million consumers annually and $57.6 billion in spending. Retail pharmacy is a $260 billion industry. We believe it's only a matter of time before the bulk of the pharmacy industry will fulfill customer needs through same-day delivery and customers standing in line at a pharmacy counter will be a thing of the past. By offering a much more convenient, efficient, and zero cost service, NowRx eliminates the need for its customers to ever visit crowded pharmacies, enabling them to stay at home with their families or remain in their office or at their place of business. Furthermore, NowRx increases the likelihood of timely prescription fills, encourages medication adherence, reduces the number of missed refills, ultimately reducing costs to health plan insurers and providing better consumer health. For employers, NowRx can improve worker productivity by eliminating time employees spend off-campus having prescriptions filled and reduce overall health plan costs through better medication compliance.Gallery{{ active_product_media.title }}.",

So much so that some families skip traveling with babies altogether. \u00a0But now, with BabyQuip, families can \"Pack Light.

        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor\u2019s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive securities, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in Lenmo Inc.How does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Lenmo Inc..

Lenmo provides lenders with data to make an informed investment decision, this includes credit report data, history, as well as aggregated income and expenses from the last 90 days pulled from the borrower\u2019s primary bank account.For individual users, we currently have a consumer app available on the Apple App Store as well as on Google Play.For financial institutions, we have recently launched Lenmo Enterprise, a digital end-to-end solution designed to make investing in the small amount loan market seamless with 45 enterprise signups and 75 in the pipeline.Users remain completely anonymous throughout the entire borrowing/lending process. For transparency and to encourage a fair and competitive market, the \u201cfeed\u201d tab within the app allows users to see which loans are being funded and at what interest rate.How it works for Borrowers:Borrowers choose their payback term and ultimately they decide whether or not to accept an interest rate that has been offered. Borrowers have the opportunity to have multiple lenders compete to fund their loan. The process is completely digital - no need to do any paperwork or go a bank or lending institutionHow it works for Lenders:Lenders do not have to pay any fees to use the platform. Lenders can leverage Lenmo to diversify their portfolio in a market with low volatility. Lenders can easily choose investments that suit their risk profile and offer corresponding interest ratesWhy businesses use Lenmo Enterprise?No lending costs - we manage the time-consuming administrative tasksCentralized, easily accessible data - lenders only pay for the data they needNo acquisition costs - Lenmo acquires borrowers on behalf of lendersAll data on one place - Save time and money for a huge data integration cost. Lenmo provides you with the data you need when you need itAutomated collections - Lenmo connects directly to borrowers\u2019 bank accounts and transfers paymentsSimplified underwriting - Lenders can easily filter the criteria and set their underwriting rules that fit their investment strategy and make an offer.\u00a0\u00a0Safe and secure - Lenmo uses machine learning and the latest identity verification technology to authenticate borrowersBusiness Model:Lenmo charges borrowers on our platform 1% of the loan principal or a minimum of $3 regardless of interest rate and payback period. The fee and borrowed amounts are included in the borrower's loan request and covered in their payments.Lenmo Enterprise, our business solution for financial institutions and lending businesses, charges the same 1% of the loan principal or a minimum of $3 per loan to borrowers.\u00a0Lenmo enterprise allows companies to setup their first account and user without incurring any cost and charges $84.99/user/month for any additional user/employee added to the company\u2019s account.We have plans for new data partnerships and other monetization opportunities such as integration with existing and alternative data service providers and scoring models. This will create new monetization opportunities and create more significant opportunities for revenue to the investors on our platform.Gallery{{ active_product_media.title }}.",

        "company_description": "Goods Unite Us intersects two of the largest markets in the U.S.: politics and shopping. Our iOS app, Android app and website provide the political leanings of over 4,000 brands and companies. Or users can search by politician and see a list of the brands and companies that support them.At Goods Unite Us, we want to make it easy for consumers to shop according to their political beliefs. This might sound strange to some. But we know that politically active consumers are looking for a way to make a difference every day--not just at the ballot box. And our free app and website give them the tools to make a difference every day (or sometimes even many times per day).\u00a0In August of 2019 alone, we had a total of over 145,000 active users across our platforms.\u00a0Perhaps most importantly, however, users are using our data to change their purchasing behaviors, which we view as the holy grail.\u00a0We've received hundreds of emails from users telling us that they've changed cars, banks, grocery stores, clothing stores, etc. based on our data.\u00a0\u00a0And businesses are taking notice. The owner of Teva sandals (Deckers Outdoor Corporation), for example, tried to strong-arm us into taking down their page. And Chico's (a company with $2B+ in revenue) tried to get us to change how we present our data on their page. (We, of course, refused both requests and are well within our first-amendment legal rights).\u00a0As described in the market landscape section below, we are in the process of implementing multiple revenue pathways, including ads, political donations through the apps, and company marketing packages.\u00a0Based on our current CAC alone, with this raise we expect to have over 1 million MAUs by election day 2020. With significant press and/or virality (both of which we think are likely), we expect to have 5 million MAUs by election day. Based on ARR and market cap valuations of comparable apps, we estimate the company valuation with 1 million MAUs to be in the range of $17 to $73 million and with 5 million MAUs to be in the range of $88 to $365 million*.\u00a0Invest in us. And we can collectively clean-up politics in this country and make money doing it!\u00a0",
        "faqs": "Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor\u2019s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive securities, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in Goods Unite Us, Inc.How does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Goods Unite Us, Inc..
